                    ended up tutoring the capstone subjects for this major after my finishing year.

                    Throughout my degree, I have learnt a vast amount about coding, designing, and teamwork. Here are some
                    skills/tools I have practiced over the last few years: </p>

                <p>Outside of studies, I made commitments to the UQ dance society. In which I have learnt many different
                    Latin dance styles. Involvement with the club gave me an opportunity to take my experience with design into play. Here are some business card mock-ups that I created specifically for the club. </p>

                <p>From 2016 to 2018 I have been working as a tutor at the University of Queensland. At the uni, I have
                    had the opportunity to work in design-focused Information Technology subjects with a large group of
                    academics. Over these years I have taught in a range of subjects varying in difficulty from first to
                    third year. </p>

                <p>Here is an outline of what the courses involved and what I was tasked to do as a tutor.</p>

                    Prototypes. The interactive product being the deviation away from computing standard input/output.
                    Essentially creating an experience for the user might not have been placed in during usual computing
                    tasks. </p>

                <p>Peer Code Review was a capstone project for IT at UQ. This project was based around getting feedback
                    about code to students. Students were able to review their peer's code on this platform upon upload.
                    This website was built with teaching staff, students, and the schooling institutes in mind. </p>

                    could either in succession or randomly assign students to partners or groups where code could be
                    shared and reviewed. </p>

                <h3>Say Hello</h3>
                <p>Say hello was a final semester project in the physical computing course. The project aimed to
                    increase interaction between employees in the workplace. The product itself was in the form of an
                    interactive walkway. As people walk onto the walkway space images were projected to encapsulate each
                    user. Once the users were located our system would draw connections to each other individual on the
                    walkway. This would work for up to 6 people. If the persons on the walkway interacted in a certain
                    way we would pick up certain natural movements and change the walkway accordingly possibly prompting
                    more conversation or kickstarting that hello to someone new in the workplace. The walkway also had a
                    mode where people within the floor could interact with games and even serve workplace memos.

                    by UQ. My team and I have also showcased the project at UQ open day events. </p>
                <p>Within this project, my sole role was to program parts of the functionality for the interactive
                    floor. We used unity and the C# language to handle the walkway logic as a 2D game. A Microsoft
                    Kinect was used to track the users and their position in real time, this was then displayed as a
                    projection on the ground. The Kinect also gave us gesture information, which we captured and used to
                    trigger events as people interacted with each other. Some examples of these interactions (hi five,
                    closeness, shaking hands). </p>

                        below.</p>
